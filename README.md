# first version of the bot pretty basic stuff

# SETUP:

- in the config file, hope it's all pretty explanatory, for local tests set the proxy to false doesn't really matter
- do remmber to set use_proxy to true if u do have working proxies
- pass the username and password of the user from whom the dm is gonna be sent with the message
- just http and socks5 proxies allowed if using any 
- better the proxies, the more efficiency you get. âœ…
